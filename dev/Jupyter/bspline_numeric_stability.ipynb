    "# Numeric Stability and Speed of B-Splines\n",
    "## Context\n",
    "Splines are piecewise polynomials that are built as the weighted sum of integer-shifted B-splines, themselves being piecewise polynomials, too. The weights are called the spline coefficients. Formally, a spline of degree $n\\in{\\mathbb{N}}$ is the mapping\n",
    "\n",
    "$(1)$\n",
    "$$f:{\\mathbb{R}}\\rightarrow{\\mathbb{R}},x\\mapsto f(x)=\\sum_{k\\in{\\mathbb{Z}}}\\,c[k]\\,\\beta^{n}(x-k),$$\n",
    "where $c$ are the spline coefficients and $\\beta^{n}$ the B-spline basis. To accurately evalute the spline $f$ at the argument $x$, it is crucial that the computation of the basis $\\beta^{n}$ be stable numerically. This is easy to achieve for small degrees; when the degree rises, however, one has to face the fact that the involved polynomials have a tendency to be made of delicately balancing terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we investigate how the numerical stability depends on the way B-splines are computed. The splinekit library proposes a remarquably stable strategy that results in the very fast and *constant-speed* evaluation of B-splines.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classic Formula\n",
    "The classic, productive representation of the $m$th derivative of a B-spline of degree $n\\in{\\mathbb{N}}$ and argument $x\\in{\\mathbb{R}}$ is\n",
    "\n",
    "$(2)$\n",
    "$$\\frac{{\\mathrm{d}}^{m}\\beta^{n}(x)}{{\\mathrm{d}}x^{m}}=\\sum_{k=0}^{n+1}\\,\\left(-1\\right)^{k}\\,{n+1\\choose k}\\,\\varsigma^{n-m}(x+\\frac{n+1}{2}-k).$$\n",
    "Unfortunately, the term $\\left(-1\\right)^{k}$ results in contributions that tend to cancel each other. This spells numerical trouble, even if the polynomial simple element $\\varsigma^{n}(x)=\\frac{1}{2\\,n!}\\,{\\mathrm{sgn}}(x)\\,x^{n}$ has the flavor of a well-behaved canonic monomial. Another issue lies with the growth of the binomial coefficients with respect to the degree. (To compute a non-differentiated B-spline, simply set $m=0$.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### De Boor\n",
    "Other computational recipes have been devised. For instance, the De Boor's recurrence relation expresses a B-spline of some degree as a weighted combination of B-splines of lesser degree. As defined in $(2)$, it turns out that $\\beta^{0}(x)=\\varsigma^{0}(x+\\frac{1}{2})-\\varsigma^{0}(x-\\frac{1}{2}).$ Then, it holds for $n\\in{\\mathbb{N}}+1$ that\n",
    "\n",
    "$(3)$\n",
    "$$\\beta^{n}(x)=\\frac{1}{n}\\,\\left(\\left(x+\\frac{n+1}{2}\\right)\\,\\beta^{n-1}(x+\\frac{1}{2})-\\left(x-\\frac{n+1}{2}\\right)\\,\\beta^{n-1}(x-\\frac{1}{2})\\right).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Splinekit\n",
    "In this library, B-splines of degree $n=0$ are computed as in the classic or the De Boor's approach. B-splines of positive degree, however, are computed as the scalar product\n",
    "\n",
    "$(4)$\n",
    "$$\\beta^{n}(x)={\\mathbf{[\\![}}\\left|x\\right|<\\frac{n+1}{2}\\,{\\mathbf{]\\!]}}\\,\\left(w^{n}[r][\\cdot]\\right)^{{\\mathsf{T}}}\\,{\\mathbf{v}}^{n}(\\chi),$$\n",
    "where the notation ${\\mathbf{[\\![}}\\cdot\\,{\\mathbf{]\\!]}}$ is that of the Iverson bracket. Moreover, $r=\\left\\lceil\\xi\\right\\rceil\\in{\\mathbb{Z}}$ for $\\xi=\\left(\\frac{n-1}{2}-x\\right)$, and $\\chi=\\left(r-\\xi\\right)\\in[0,1)$. Finally, $\\left(w^{n}[r][\\cdot]\\right)^{{\\mathsf{T}}}$ is the $(r+1)$th row of the B-spline evaluation matrix ${\\mathbf{W}}^{n}\\in{\\mathbb{Q}}^{\\left(n+1\\right)\\times\\left(n+1\\right)}$ and ${\\mathbf{v}}^{n}(\\chi)\\in{\\mathbb{R}}^{n+1}$ is the Vandermonde vector of argument $\\chi$ and degree $n$. In this formulation of a B-spline, the fact that the Vandermonde vector has the domain $[0,1)$ greatly favors numerical stability since the range of each of its components is $[0,1]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The matrix ${\\mathbf{W}}^{n}$ depends on the degree only and can be precomputed and cached. Its component at the $(r+1)$th row and $(c+1)$th column is rational and is defined as\n",
    "\n",
    "$(5)$\n",
    "$$w_{r+1,c+1}^{n}=w^{n}[r][c]=\\frac{1}{c!}\\,\\left(\\left.\\frac{{\\mathrm{d}}^{c}\\beta^{n}(x)}{{\\mathrm{d}}x^{c}}\\right|_{x=\\frac{n-1}{2}-r}+\\frac{1}{2}\\,{\\mathbf{[\\![}}c=n\\,{\\mathbf{]\\!]}}\\,\\left(-1\\right)^{n-r}\\,{n+1\\choose r+1}\\right).$$\n",
    "The B-spline derivatives that appear in $(5)$ are computed as rational numbers, through $(2)$. This leads to a rational value for $w^{n}[r][c]$, which is then cached as its ``float`` approximation. With this strategy, the balancing act that was governed in $(2)$ by the term $\\left(-1\\right)^{k}$ is now applied to rational values and can be achieved exactly in the rational domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal\n",
    "Here, we want to compare four computational approaches.\n",
    "-   In the first (ground-truth) approach, we rely on the observation that $\\beta^{n}:{\\mathbb{R}}\\rightarrow{\\mathbb{R}}$ is defined in $(2)$ in such a way that $\\beta^{n}$ would map a rational number to a number that is rational, too, so that $\\beta^{n}:{\\mathbb{Q}}\\rightarrow{\\mathbb{Q}}$. This allows us to compute exact, ground-truth values by relying on Python's built-in ``Fraction`` type.\n",
    "-   In the second (classic) approach, we compute $\\beta^{n}$ as in $(2)$, this time relying on Python's built-in ``float`` type.\n",
    "-   In the third (De Boor) approach, we compute $\\beta^{n}$ as in $(3)$, again relying on Python's built-in ``float`` type.\n",
    "-   In the fourth (splinekit) approach, we compute $\\beta^{n}$ as in $(4)$, relying on Python's built-in ``float`` type.\n",
    "\n",
    "What we measure is by how far the methods depart from the ground truth, in a mean-square sense. The error being most noticeable near the end of the left and right tails of the B-spline, this is where the error is computed. We also report the computational time."

    "## Discussion\n",
    "-   The numerical stability of the classic approach is consistently the worst at all degrees. Moreover, it even collapses when the degree rises: for degree $n=16$ already, there is more noise than data. The computational cost exhibits a linear increase over the degrees explored here. Yet, the classic approach is still the fastest over the goldilocks range of degrees $n\\in\\{3,4,5,6\\}$, a range where its accuracy can also be considered sufficient for most purposes.\n",
    "-   The numerical stability of the De Boor's approach is always the best (310dB corresponds to about 51 significant bits) but comes at a computational cost that increases exponentially with the degree. Yet, the trivial code proposed here comes the fastest over the small range of degrees $n\\in\\{0,1,2\\}$. For such low degrees, however, one has to realize that the computational cost depends more on language business (*e.g.*, namespace lookup, recursivity *vs* loops, checks on type and validity of the parameters) than on algorithmic considerations.\n",
    "-   The numerical stability of the splinekit library is consistently much higher than that of the classic approach and degrades more slowly with the degree (270dB corresponds to about $45$ significant bits). Indeed, one has to reach the very high degree $n=94$ before the $0$ dB threshold is crossed.\n",
    "-   For degree $n=16$, splinekit is about eight thousand times faster than De Boor while, for degree $n=7$ and higher, the splinekit strategy is always faster than the other three. The computation time of splinekit remains constant through all degrees, a property that holds up to $n=94$ and beyond."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "B-splines of small degrees can be computed through the classic method if one is willing to sacrifice some modest amount of accuracy in the interest of speed. For higher degrees, however, the approach followed by the splinekit library is to be preferred. The De Boor's method is not recommended in reason of its outrageously slow performance."
