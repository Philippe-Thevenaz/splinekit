    "## Interpolating Cardinal B-Spline\n",
    "The splines handled by this library are made of polynomial pieces of unit length and same degree, which sets constraints on $\\varphi.$ Despite these constraints, many equivalent bases exist, some being more suitable than others. One very good basis is the B-spline $\\varphi_{1}=\\beta^{n},$ whose superscript $n$ indicates its polynomial degree. It has many favorable properties but comes at a price: it is not interpolating, which means that it is not trivial to determine the coefficients that ensure that the spline takes imposed values. More precisely, given the sequence $\\left(y[q]\\right)_{q\\in{\\mathbb{Z}}}$, some work is required to find $c_{1}$ such that\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\left(y[q]\\right)_{q\\in{\\mathbb{Z}}}=\\left(\\sum_{k\\in{\\mathbb{R}}}\\,c_{1}[k]\\,\\beta^{n}(q-k)\\right)_{q\\in{\\mathbb{Z}}}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Meanwhile, there exists an interpolating basis $\\varphi_{2}=\\eta^{n},$ called a cardinal B-spline. Some of its mathematical properties can be considered less favorable than those of B-splines; most notably, contrarily to B-splines, the support of cardinal B-splines is infinite, which makes it an impractical basis. Yet, its interpolating property (according to which $\\eta^{n}(0)=1$ and $\\eta^{n}(k)=0$ for $k\\in{\\mathbb{Z}}\\setminus\\{0\\}$) greatly facilitates the determination of the coefficients of the representation. Indeed, it is enough to let $c_{2}=y$ to automatically get that\n",

    "\n",
    "Here, we plot a cardinal B-spline, indexed by its degree. The hollow (blue or red) circles indicate the samples at the integers. The function is made of polynomial pieces that lie between so-called knots. The small filled (black) discs indicate the location of the knots of the spline."
