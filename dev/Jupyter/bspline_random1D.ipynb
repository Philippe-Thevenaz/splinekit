    "# B-Splines *vs* Splines\n",
    "\n",
    "The B-splines are the functions that are used as construction blocks to build splines. The letter B in B-spline stands for *basis*. We are first going to give the intuition of what a basis is, by making a detour with the representation of numbers. Then, we introduce regular splines as a weighted sum of integer-shifted B-splines. Finally, we discuss B-splines and give just a few of their numerous properties. We conclude with a graphical representation of random splines."

    "## Representation of Numbers\n",
    "Unlike in the antique world, the modern representation of numbers is positional, with digits. For instance, the number forty-two consists of the decimal digits $4$ and $2,$ with $4$ to the left and $2$ to the right.\n",
    "\n",
    "Digits are the construction blocks of numbers. They are associated to a *base* (not a basis); in everyday life, the base is ten. In a computer, the binary base is two. Geeks would write octal numbers in base eight or hexadecimal numbers in base sixteen. Assuming the subscript is written in base ten, one would notate\n",
    "\n",
    "$$42_{10}=2{\\mathrm{A}}_{16}=52_{8}=101010_{2}.$$\n",
    "In the positional notation, numbers are given by an infinite-length list of digits. Formally, if $b$ is the base, the synthesis of a nonnegative integer number $m\\in{\\mathbb{N}}$ from its digits $\\left(d[k]\\right)_{k\\in{\\mathbb{N}}}$ is understood to be\n",
    "\n",
    "$$m=\\sum_{k\\in{\\mathbb{N}}}\\,d[k]\\,b^{k},\\;m\\in{\\mathbb{N}}.$$\n",
    "In written form, the digits are ordered by their index, from high index to low index. The leftmost digits of value zero are omitted, which makes for a finite-length string when the number $m$ is itself finite, even if the list of digits is implicitly infinite—at least, to the left.\n",
    "*   The finiteness property may change. Typically, your everyday-life number may possibly be an integer, but sometimes it is also an irrational number $x.$ In this case, the representation is extended by considering digits $\\left(d[k]\\right)_{k\\in{\\mathbb{Z}}}$ with both negative and positive indices, like in\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$x=\\sum_{k\\in{\\mathbb{Z}}}\\,d[k]\\,b^{k},\\;x\\in{\\mathbb{R}}.$$\n",
    "    In written form, the zeros to the left are omitted, while the digits to the right are truncated.\n",
    "*   The finiteness property may change in another way, with exotic numbers called $p$-adic numbers. While you are not likely to ever encounter such numbers in everyday life, know that one of their representations sees them as integers with an infinite-length stream of digits to the left, all of these digits being significant, in the same way as the digits of the irrational numbers are significant to the right.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have now made the point that a number can be synthesized by an *infinite* sum of *indexed weights* (the digits) that multiply some *index-dependent operation* on a base (the canonic number $b$ to the power of the index). We have omitted details such as the handling of the sign, or discussed the assumption that the base is an integer or, if it is indeed an integer, that the digits take integer values restricted to $d[k]\\in[0\\ldots b-1].$"

    "## Splines\n",
    "Splines are functions. In other words, they are mappings that associate an input real number to some (often different) output number. To be called splines, these functions are not entirely arbitrary but obey some rules and follow some structure. Specifically, they are number-like, written as the functional recipe\n",

However, whereas the base was raised to the integer power $k,$ the basis now is shifted by the integer amount $k.$ (In some elaborate versions of splines, the shift is allowed to take noninteger values and even to vary with the index; here we limit ourselves to integer shifts, in which case the splines are said to be *regular*.)"

    "## Bases\n",
    "Given the number $x$, many a base $b$ can be adopted to represent its value, with adjusted digits $d$. Likewise, given a spline $f$, many a basis $\\varphi$ can be adopted to represent the function, with adjusted weights $c$. For $f$ to be truly called a spline, however, the basis itself must adhere to some specific constraints. As we consider only *polynomial* regular splines of degree $n\\in{\\mathbb{N}}$, the basis $\\varphi$ must\n",
    "*   be a piecewise polynomial of degree $n$ with pieces of unit length;\n",
    "*   be $\\left(n-1\\right)$-times continuously differentiable and $n$-times differentiable;\n",
    "*   have its $n$th derivative be necessarily discontinous in at least one place.\n",
    "\n",
    "These properties go a long way but are not sufficient. The true technical requirements demand for an understanding that goes beyond calculus. We do not reproduce them here, except to say that $\\varphi$ must be a Riesz basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "In its canonical form, the basis is possibly the odd- or even-symmetric polynomial simple element of nonnegative integer degree $n\\in{\\mathbb{N}},$ a function notated $\\varsigma^{n}$ with $n$ a superscript–not a power. It maps $x\\in{\\mathbb{R}}$ to $\\varsigma^{n}(x)=\\frac{1}{2\\,n!}\\,{\\mathrm{sgn}}(x)\\,x^{n}.$ Alternatively, it can also be the one-sided function that maps $x\\in{\\mathbb{R}}_{<0}$ to $0$ and $x\\in{\\mathbb{R}}_{\\geq0}$ to $x^{n}.$ However, unlike $\\varsigma^{n},$ the one-sided function is restricted to those integer degrees that are positive since it is not well-defined at $x=0$ for $n=0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "These canonic versions have their uses since their simplicity facilitates theoretical developments. However, they are just terribly bad in practice. In any case, the important thing to remember is that, just like one given number admits a representation in any arbitrary base, one given spline admits a representation in any arbitrary basis."

In practice, its most appealing property is its finite support, which is conductive to fast algorithms. At the same time, it has remarkable properties beyond those linked to differentiablity, a few of them being as follows.\n",

Meanwhile, the general appearance of quadratic splines is very difficult to tell apart from that of splines of higher degrees.
