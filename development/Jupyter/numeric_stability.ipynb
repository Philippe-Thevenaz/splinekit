    "# Numeric Stability of B-Splines\n",
    "\n",
    "## Context\n",
    "Splines are piecewise polynomials that are built as the weighted sum of\n",
    "B-splines, themselves being piecewise polynomials. The weights are\n",
    "called the spline coefficients. Formally, a spline is the mapping\n",
    "\n",
    "$(1)$\n",
    "$$f:{\\mathbb{R}}\\rightarrow{\\mathbb{R}},\n",
    "x\\mapsto f(x)=\\sum_{k\\in{\\mathbb{Z}}}\\,c[k]\\,\\beta^{n}(x-k),$$\n",
    "where $c$ are the spline coefficients, $n$ the degree of the spline,\n",
    "and $\\beta^{n}$ the B-spline basis. To accurately evalute the spline $f$\n",
    "at the argument $x$, it is crucial that the computation of the basis\n",
    "$\\beta^{n}$ be stable numerically. This is easy to achieve for small\n",
    "degrees; when the degree rises, however, one has to face the fact that\n",
    "the involved polynomials have a tendency to be made of delicately\n",
    "balancing terms. For instance, a productive representation of a\n",
    "B-spline would be\n",
    "\n",
    "$(2)$\n",
    "$$\\beta^{n}(x)=\\sum_{k=0}^{n+1}\\,\\left(-1\\right)^{k}\\,{n+1\\choose k}\\,\n",
    "\\varsigma^{n}(x+\\frac{n+1}{2}-k),$$\n",
    "where the term $\\left(-1\\right)^{k}$ spells numerical trouble even if\n",
    "the polynomial simple element $\\varsigma^{n}(x)=\\frac{1}{2\\,n!}\\,\n",
    "{\\mathrm{sgn}}(x)\\,x^{n}$ has the flavor of a well-behaved canonic\n",
    "monomial. Another issue lies with the growth of the binomial coefficients\n",
    "with respect to the degree. \n",
    "\n",
    "Other computational recipes have been devised. For instance, the De Boor's\n",
    "relation expresses a B-spline of some degree as a recursive weighted\n",
    "combination of B-splines of lesser degree. As defined in $(2)$, it turns\n",
    "out that $\\beta^{0}(x)=\\varsigma^{0}(x+\\frac{1}{2})-\\varsigma^{0}(x-\n",
    "\\frac{1}{2}).$ Then, it holds for $n\\in{\\mathbb{N}}+1$ that\n",
    "\n",
    "$(3)$\n",
    "$$\\beta^{n}(x)=\\frac{1}{n}\\,\\left(\\left(x+\\frac{n+1}{2}\\right)\\,\n",
    "\\beta^{n-1}(x+\\frac{1}{2})-\\left(x-\\frac{n+1}{2}\\right)\\,\n",
    "\\beta^{n-1}(x-\\frac{1}{2})\\right).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal\n",
    "Here, we want to compare four computational approaches.\n",
    "-   The first approach relies on the observation that\n",
    "    $\\beta^{n}:{\\mathbb{R}}\\rightarrow{\\mathbb{R}}$\n",
    "    is defined in $(2)$ in such a way that $\\beta^{n}$ would map a\n",
    "    rational number to a number that is rational, too, so that\n",
    "    $\\beta^{n}:{\\mathbb{Q}}\\rightarrow{\\mathbb{Q}}$. This allows us\n",
    "    to compute exact, ground-truth values by relying on Python's\n",
    "    built-in ``Fraction`` type.\n",
    "-   The second approach is to compute $\\beta^{n}$ as in $(2)$, this time\n",
    "    relying on Python's built-in ``float`` type.\n",
    "-   The third approach  is to compute $\\beta^{n}$ as in $(3)$, while\n",
    "    relying on Python's built-in ``float`` type.\n",
    "-   The fourth approach is to compute $\\beta^{n}$ as is done in this\n",
    "    library and explained in details at various places, for instance\n",
    "    in the documentation of the function ``splinekit.bsplines.b_spline``.\n",
    "-   Here is a link [splinekit.bsplines.b_spline](https://../../docs/build/bsplines/index.html)"
